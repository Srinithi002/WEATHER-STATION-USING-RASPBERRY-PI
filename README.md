# WEATHER-STATION-USING-RASPBERRY-PI
In this project, we made Mini Weather Station using DHT11 Humidity  Temperature Sensor &amp; Raspberry Pi Pico. A weather station is a system of  integrated components that automatically measure, record, and sometimes transmit  weather data.In this project, the ambient temperature value and humidity value are monitored in real-time through the DHT11 Temperature & Humidity sensor and displayed on the 16Ã—2 I2C LCD module synchronously. When the temperature is too high or the humidity is too low, it will trigger the LED light to turn on and off to remind.
